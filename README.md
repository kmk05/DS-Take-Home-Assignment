# DS-Take-Home-Assignment
Impact of COVID-19 on air quality:
In this project changes in AOD during COVID-19 lockdown are analysed using satellite data.


#Introduction to datasets:
Aerosol optical depth images are downloaded from NASA's LANDS DAAC website. For this study, NO2 and SO2 concentrations of pollutants were analysed year-wise. This data is available on government websites such as the central pollution control board. MOD04_L2 - MODIS/Terra Aerosol 5-Min L2 Swath 10km data was used for aerosol optical depth
The links to the above websites are as follows:
